# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Which records are supported?
We support the following records:
- A
- AAAA
- CNAME
- MX
- NS
- TXT

## Why does my domain still redirect to the is-a-dev website?
This usually occurs due to the cache of your browser becoming invalid and [clearing your browser's cache](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050) should solve this issue.

## Can I use a CNAME record with any other records?
You cannot request a subdomain nor submit changes containing a CNAME with any other records (TXT, A, MX, etc...)

## How long will it take for my PR to get merged?
When we get into it. We always want you to wait for as short as possible. But maintainers cannot always be online. We have school and work, this is just a side project.

## How can I delete my domain?
You can delete your domain's JSON file and submit a pull request to delete your domain.

You need to go to your GitHub Pages settings on your website repository (likely called `<user.github.io>`) and make sure the `Enforce HTTPS` option is enabled to avoid this error.

1. **Commit your changes:** Once you've made your changes, commit them to your local repository.

1. **Push your changes:** Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
