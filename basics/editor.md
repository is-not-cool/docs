# Github Pages

using github pages as your provider is really easy, just first follow the steps on "quickstart", after your pull request gets accepted, go to your repository settings, click "Pages", then "Deploy from a branch" then scroll down until "Custom Domain", if my subdomain was "brainrot", i would put in brainrot.is-not.cool.
